# ML_Python_Proj
A repository for a machine learning project in Python.

The project for "Introduction to Python" course at Kozminski University. The aim of the project was to create a machine learning model that is able to distinguish between photos of cats and dogs and correctly label them. The project was done using Python 3.9 in Jupyter Notebooks and Keras.
The photos taken for this project were from the kaggle 'cats vs dogs' competition from the 'train.zip' file.

The folder with photos is not in this repository, since the folder has 25 thousand images inside and would be too large to sensibly upload here.
